City Guide! 
This is an app tutorial created from Android BootCamp. 
I used the KitKat Version, so it should be compatable with Android devices that allow Kitkat.
We created a list view in this App.
This app give you a link to the Art Institue in Chicago, and to the Magnificent Mile. 
It also show you some images of the Navy Pier located in Chicago, the water tower, and this Willis Tower. 

We imported images into the drawable folder which allowed us to make these images avaliable to user.
